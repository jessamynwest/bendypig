 The first thing I will give up, when I finally decide to give everything
 up, will be that damn computer. I'll take it and drop it off the I-5
 Bridge and I'll enjoy the sound of impact.
<p align=justify>
 
 The next thing, the very next thing, will be my car. I will drive East
 until the fuel gauge reads "Empty." Then I'll drive into the center of
 some field and leave it there. I don't care. I'll walk back.
 <p align=justify>
 When I get back to town, I will take my watch and chuck it at a passing
 bus. I will throw my wallet down a storm drain and fling my checkbook
 into the fountain at Westlake Center. 
 <p align=justify>
 I'll take that hand mixer I've been moving around from apartment to
 apartment and I'll bury it in the neighbor's yard. All those tape
 dispensers I've stolen from all those offices I've worked in, I'll
 donate those to the blind. 
 <p align=justify>
 I have four exposed but undeveloped Kodak FunSaver cameras from the
 early 1990s. These I will glue together and set on fire in front of the
 King Five news station. I will watch the news one last time to see if
 I've gotten my point across.
 <p align=justify>
 Which reminds me. That new TV I just bought? I will drag it up to the
 roof of my house and put it on the chimney. High winds can take it from
 there. 
 <p align=justify>

 I have a shower curtain that I will cut into strips and set on fire in
 the driveway. I have a "Greetings from Nashville" mug that I will pound
 into ceramic dust with a hammer. I will then use the hammer on the
 scissors I used on the shower curtain. I have not yet determined what to
 do with the hammer. 
 <p align=justify>
 I will take the contents of my closet, the living representation of
 years of bad decision making, and I will put them in the compost pile.
 So as to avoid arousing any more suspicion than absolutely necessary, I
 will save one pair of shoes, one pair of socks, one pair of classic fit
 Eddie Bauer jeans with the label ripped off and one T-shirt. This
 T-shirt will not say "ESPN" on it or "New York University." It will be
 green.
 <p align=justify>
 I won't do anything to the house I rent. It's wrapped in vinyl siding
 and the electrial wiring is eighty years old. It's set to go right now
 and when it does, it'll go like a cherry bomb. But I'll be long gone by
 then. 
 <p align=justify>
 I plan to head south. I'll keep to the side roads. I'll steal apples on
 the way. I'll walk til the color of the landscape changes. I'll keep
 walking until the color of the people changes. Then I'll walk some more. 
 <p align=justify>
 I'll walk until it starts to get cold again. By this time, of course, I
 won't care. When I get to the very bottom of the very end of everything,
 I'll dive into the ocean and start swimming. I'll swim until midnight
 and then pull myself up onto a passing ice flow. Then I'll just lie
 back... and look up...      at totally different stars.
