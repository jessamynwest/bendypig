When I was a kid, my mom would always make me go into the post office while she 
stayed in the car. She gave me money to buy her stamps. "Ask for the pretty stamps" she would always say.
I was a painfully shy child and asking for anything other than just stamps was excruciating, but less
of a drag than letting down my Mom.<P>
At some point, I realized that even the pretty stamps weren't that pretty to me.
