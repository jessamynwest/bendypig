<B>You must change your life fourteen times. <br>
Change your way of living like writing. <br>
You must change your method and your mind. You <br>

Have to transform life fourteen times. Change life.<br> 
It has become necessary to change your life. <br>
And now you'd better change it: you, yourself. <br>
It's up to you to exchange your life. Change, change! <br>
Alter your life, patch and re-shape your life. <br>
"A change came o'er the spirit of your change." <br>
You might shuffle the cards spin wheels change wheels. <br>
You must convert resolve revolutionize your dissolves. <br>
You might change life itself. And you might change. <br>

You must change. You must not outlive your life. <p>
Archaic Torsos by David Shapiro </B>
